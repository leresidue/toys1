#basics instructions on how to compile toys1 (pour les débutants)

1. Create a new "Application de bureau Windows" C++ project in Visual Studio, called "toys1app"

2. Find the toys1app folder inside the toys1app folder

3. Drag-and-drop the files from this repository, to the found folder (if Windows ask to replace some files, say 'yes')

4. In the 'Explorateur de solutions' pane, add all the files copied from the repository that are missing from the pane

5. Press 'Débogueur Windows local', and if you see a gray window whose title is 'ALLÔ', then you know that the project compiled successfully.

Good luck with your endeavours, and please tell me if the instructions provided (or the source code) are lacking or buggy, and I will try my best to improve the situation. :-)
