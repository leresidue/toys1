# toys1

This is the skeleton of a new interactive interface language called ToySanta. The purposes of this language are:

1. Make user interfaces more easily, and easily customizables by the  users.
2. Just write once your C++ code.
3. Just write once your ToySanta code.
4. Let your uses develop new interfaces, and possibly new features.
5. Security.

I believe that security comes from predictability. So if something is predictable, you can depend on it. If you can depend on it, you'll feel secure using it.

This project is in its infancy, so, there's no functionnal prototype at this time. :-(
